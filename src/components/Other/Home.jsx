        convenient way to manage both your tasks and your shopping items in one
        place.

        With the to-do list feature, you can easily keep track of your daily
        tasks, assignments, or any other activities you need to complete. You
        can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and even edit or delete
        existing tasks as needed.
      </p>

        Stay organized and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. On the
        other hand, the shopping cart feature allows you to create a
        personalized shopping list. Whether you're planning for groceries,
        household items, or a shopping spree, you can effortlessly add products
        to your cart, specify quantities, and remove items when you no longer
        need them.
